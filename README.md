<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://youtu.be/oszimryB3aU)

Do you have what it takes to communicate with humans? Find out and play with your friends in this epic word game.

Word Space is a language game that uses a powerful AI to determine your ability to communicate. Join your friends in this multiplayer game and see who can score the highest while laughing at the ridiculous sentences you construct along the way.

The brief for this project was to conceptualise and create a simple application using machine learning, focused either on novelty or on accessibility.

### AI

This project uses the Watson Tone Analyser which can understand emotions and communication style in text.

IBM's Watson is a question-answering supercomputer that uses artificial intelligence to perform cognitive computing and data analysis. Watson performs deep-level input analysis to present accurate answers to questions generated by humans.

### Built With

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
* [IBM Watson Tone Analyser](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/)
